### FAQs

- Do you plan to add more languages?

We can consider as long as we don't break existing languages, I will not support chinese/japanese due to the complexity it brings.

- Do you plan to add support for Windows or Macos?

Possible but my machines run on Linux so you have to report the issues if you encounter it on Windows or Macos.

- Why Tauri?

Smallest bundles and easy to port to different platforms.
